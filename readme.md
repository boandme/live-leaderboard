Goals for this app(to keep in mind): 

Leaderboard Type - 
Voting system based on random pairs of games. 
Each session: 5 pairs (10 unique games) shown.
User picks one winner from each pair.

Voting Rules - 
Each selected winner gets:
+1 to all‑time votes.
+1 to today’s trending votes.
Voting allowed once every 24 hours per user.

After voting:
Show both All‑Time Leaderboard and Trending Leaderboard.

Leaderboards
All‑Time → Sort by total votes ever received.
Trending → Sort by votes from last 7 days.

Anti‑Bias Measures
Vote counts/positions hidden during voting.
No game appears twice in the same session.

Future Features (Optional)
Elo Rating System instead of flat +1 votes.
Power Votes (worth +3, given randomly or as streak reward).
Daily Streak Bonuses for consistent voters.
Achievements for participation milestones
